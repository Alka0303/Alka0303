- 👋 Hi, I’m @Alka0303
- 👀 I’m interested in cheap automation system based on ESP32 or any microcontroller. Currently working on WIO Terminal by SEEED. DIY
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use AI to create automation sistem in greenhouses and all other systems.
- 💞️ I’m looking to I am looking to collaborate with people who share the same passion as me, specifically the automation of processes especially of hydroponic greenhouses.
                    If anyone is wi lling to collaborate in creating a mobile application, PC, Online Server, local monitoring application,
                    and an entire system that would contain various sensors and actuators that monitor and adjust the greenhouse ecosystem.
                    For more detail hope you will find me.
- 📫 How to reach me. Good question.:)
- 😄 Pronouns: ?
- ⚡ Fun fact: I started as a building administrator, 
                then a security systems technician,
                continued as a radiology technician (graduated in medicine),
                after that I became an engineer in robotics and automation,
                and now I've reached automated agriculture.
                            Isn't that funny?
                            What's next???
